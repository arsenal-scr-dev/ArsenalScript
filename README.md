# Arsenal Script - Aimbot, Aim Lock, Auto Kill, Auto Aim



An Arsenal Script is a set of code or commands that modify how Roblox Arsenal operates, typically by injecting commands into the game client to give the user advantages. These scripts range from simple visual tweaks to highly advanced hacks such as aimbots, aim lock, and auto kill, which are designed to improve aiming accuracy, automatically lock onto enemies, or even guarantee instant kills.
